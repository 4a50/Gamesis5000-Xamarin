        "overview": "Hailed as one of the greatest NES hacks of all time. This Super Mario Brothers 3 hack changes the game right down to the core by tweaking the actual game engine itself!\r\n\r\nAside from the ‘typical’ graphics and text changes, this hack alters musical melodies, a full line up of all new levels, new power ups, new abilities for Mario, and even new enemies! When I say new, I’m not talking about changed graphics; I’m talking about completely new power ups and monsters. Money mushrooms, invisible Mario, time stopping potions, Kuribo shoes in any level that don’t disappear, shy guys that create projectiles, heat seeking bullet bills, and others are just the beginning of the changes made to this game.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, you have random weather patterns on every stage, boss battles on every stage, and infinite lives, so your coins go to more useful purposes. They will be used to buy items from Toad’s house and get some level exits to appear. Let’s not forget stored, and switchable, power ups such as those found in Super Mario World!",

        "platform": 40,
        "players": 1,
        "overview": "The game Super Mario Bros 64 is the C64 - porting the NES - the game Super Mario Bros. (Original: スーパーマリオブラザーズ) of 1985. Nintendo sold more than 40 million Super Mario Bros modules , the Jump & Run was for decades as the most sold Video game of all time. With this success, the Japanese company laid the foundation stone for its supremacy in the computer games industry. In addition, the video game crash was finally overcome.\r\n\r\nThe implementation as a non-licensed fan project for the C64 and the C128 has only been around since 2019. The coder is called ZeroPaige . He worked on the program over a period of seven years, his goal was to port the NES version identically to the smallest possible detail. He did this in a very impressive way.\r\n\r\n\r\nStory and goal of the game\r\n\r\nPrincess Toadstool was caught by King Koopa (later called Bowser). Mario and his brother Luigi now want to rescue the noble lady. To do this, the two plumbers must cross a total of eight worlds, each divided into four levels . The last level is a King Koopa castle, but unfortunately you can only find doubles of the Dragon King in the first seven. There are only small mushroom creatures to be freed, Mario and Luigi with a \"Thank you! But our princess is in another castle!\" dispatch. At some point, however, every trip ends, the brothers face the right King Koopa and then find the princess.\r\n\r\n\r\nDesign \r\nThe player takes on the role of plumber Mario , who has to overcome obstacles and defeat opponents to free Princess Toadstool from King Koopa's clutches. In addition , Mario runs and jumps through the two-dimensional side view of the game world. The game is a classic side-scroller . The development of the C64 - porting took about seven years time. The implementation was as identical as possible and appears to be even more bug-free than the template.\r\n\r\nIn two-player mode, you switch when you lose a life or complete a game world. There are different items to collect and a variety of different enemies.\r\n\r\nThe NES console uses a Ricoh 2A03 as CPU , which is based on MOS Technology 6502 and is clocked at 1.77 MHz or 1.79 MHz. The C64 uses a similar processor, the 6510 . Ultimately, this only works at 0.985 MHz or 1.023 MHz. Since the NES CPU thus has a clock rate that is a good 70% faster, there are unfortunately some slowdowns on the C64 with a lot of action on the screen . If you have a super CPU for your C64, you can use a Turbo Chameleon 64 , or use a C128, this problem no longer occurs. It can also be emulated without slowdowns if you emulate a C128 or a C64 with SCPU, for example in VICE .",

Now Mario™ and Luigi™ must battle a variety of enemies, including a Koopaling in each unique and distinctive world, on their way to ultimately taking on Bowser himself. Lucky for the brothers, they have more power-ups available than ever before. Fly above the action using the Super Leaf, swim faster by donning the Frog Suit, or defeat enemies using the Hammer Bros. Suit. Use the brand-new overworld map to take the chance to play a minigame in hopes of gaining extra lives or to find a Toad’s House where you can pick up additional items. All this (and more) combines into one of gaming’s most well-known and beloved titles—are you ready to experience gaming bliss?",

The main differences with Mario IV include a different title screen and the main character being replaced by Mario. Some of the graphics were taken from from Dian Shi Ma Li and Super Mario Bros. 3. An alternate version of the hack has a stage select that allows the player to start from any one of the 8 worlds. Mario IV's origin is unknown. It is possible that it shares a developer with 7 Grand Dad, due to Mario IV's numerous releases having an nearly identical PCB to said game. It is also somewhat hinted that the J.Y. Company released it at some point.",
